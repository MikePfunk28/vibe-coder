# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an advanced AI-powered IDE built on the complete VSCode/Code-OSS foundation that provides ALL standard IDE features (identical GUI, extensions, debugging, git integration, etc.) PLUS cutting-edge AI technologies. The system will be a complete VSCode clone with Cursor-level AI capabilities, ensuring users get the full VSCode experience they know and love, enhanced with intelligent code assistance, self-improvement capabilities, and advanced developer productivity features.

**Core Architecture Principle**: VSCode/Code-OSS serves as the complete base foundation, providing 100% of standard IDE functionality. Our AI features are layered on top as extensions and enhancements, never replacing core IDE capabilities.

The system combines:
- **Complete VSCode/Code-OSS Base**: All standard editing, debugging, extension, and IDE features
- **Cursor-Level AI Features**: Chat, code completion, code generation, and AI assistance
- **Advanced AI Technologies**: PocketFlow workflows, LangChain orchestration, semantic search
- **Self-Improving AI**: Darwin-Gödel model with reinforcement learning capabilities

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types code THEN the system SHALL provide contextually relevant completions using Qwen Coder 3
2. WHEN a user requests code generation THEN the system SHALL use LangChain to orchestrate the AI workflow
3. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL consider the current file context and project structure
4. IF the AI model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to standard IDE features

### Requirement 3: PocketFlow Workflow Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated workflow management for development tasks, so that I can focus on coding while the system handles routine processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a development task THEN PocketFlow SHALL create and manage the appropriate workflow
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger relevant workflows (testing, linting, etc.)
3. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL provide feedback and next action suggestions
4. IF a workflow fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and recovery options

### Requirement 4: Semantic Similarity Search with Interleaved Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent code search that understands semantic meaning, so that I can quickly find relevant code patterns and examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for code THEN the system SHALL use semantic similarity to find relevant matches
2. WHEN providing search results THEN the system SHALL implement interleaved context sliding windows
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL rank them by semantic relevance and contextual similarity
4. WHEN the codebase changes THEN the system SHALL incrementally update the semantic index

### Requirement 5: Darwin-Gödel Self-Improving Model

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an AI system that learns and improves from my coding patterns, so that it becomes more helpful over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes code interactions THEN it SHALL analyze patterns for self-improvement opportunities
2. WHEN improvement opportunities are identified THEN the Darwin-Gödel model SHALL generate code modifications
3. WHEN modifications are proposed THEN the system SHALL validate them through mini-benchmarking
4. IF improvements pass validation THEN the system SHALL integrate them into its codebase
5. WHEN self-modifications occur THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 6: Mini-Benchmarking System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI system to measure its own performance improvements, so that I can trust that changes actually make it better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system proposes improvements THEN it SHALL run mini-benchmarks to measure performance
2. WHEN benchmarks run THEN the system SHALL test code quality, response time, and accuracy metrics
3. WHEN benchmark results are available THEN the system SHALL compare against baseline performance
4. IF improvements don't meet thresholds THEN the system SHALL reject the proposed changes

### Requirement 7: Reinforcement Learning Integration
