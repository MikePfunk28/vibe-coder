# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an advanced AI-powered IDE built on the complete VSCode/Code-OSS foundation that provides ALL standard IDE features (identical GUI, extensions, debugging, git integration, etc.) PLUS cutting-edge AI technologies. The system will be a complete VSCode clone with Cursor-level AI capabilities, ensuring users get the full VSCode experience they know and love, enhanced with intelligent code assistance, self-improvement capabilities, and advanced developer productivity features.

**Core Architecture Principle**: VSCode/Code-OSS serves as the complete base foundation, providing 100% of standard IDE functionality. Our AI features are layered on top as extensions and enhancements, never replacing core IDE capabilities.

The system combines:
- **Complete VSCode/Code-OSS Base**: All standard editing, debugging, extension, and IDE features
- **Cursor-Level AI Features**: Chat, code completion, code generation, and AI assistance
- **Advanced AI Technologies**: PocketFlow workflows, LangChain orchestration, semantic search
- **Self-Improving AI**: Darwin-Gödel model with reinforcement learning capabilities
