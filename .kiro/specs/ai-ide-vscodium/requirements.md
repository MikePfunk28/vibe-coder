# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an advanced AI-powered IDE based on VSCodium that integrates multiple cutting-edge AI technologies to provide intelligent code assistance, self-improvement capabilities, and enhanced developer productivity. The system will combine PocketFlow for workflow management, LangChain for AI orchestration, LM Studio with Qwen Coder 3 for code generation, semantic similarity search with interleaved context sliding windows, and a Darwin-Gödel self-improving model with reinforcement learning capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core IDE Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a VSCodium-based IDE with AI capabilities, so that I can have a familiar development environment enhanced with intelligent features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the IDE is launched THEN the system SHALL initialize VSCodium with custom AI extensions
2. WHEN a user opens a project THEN the system SHALL automatically index the codebase for semantic search
3. WHEN the IDE starts THEN the system SHALL establish connection to LM Studio with Qwen Coder 3 model
4. IF VSCodium fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms and error recovery

### Requirement 2: AI Code Assistant Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent code completion and generation, so that I can write code more efficiently with AI assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types code THEN the system SHALL provide contextually relevant completions using Qwen Coder 3
2. WHEN a user requests code generation THEN the system SHALL use LangChain to orchestrate the AI workflow
3. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL consider the current file context and project structure
4. IF the AI model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to standard IDE features

### Requirement 3: PocketFlow Workflow Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated workflow management for development tasks, so that I can focus on coding while the system handles routine processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a development task THEN PocketFlow SHALL create and manage the appropriate workflow
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger relevant workflows (testing, linting, etc.)
3. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL provide feedback and next action suggestions
4. IF a workflow fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and recovery options

### Requirement 4: Semantic Similarity Search with Interleaved Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent code search that understands semantic meaning, so that I can quickly find relevant code patterns and examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for code THEN the system SHALL use semantic similarity to find relevant matches
2. WHEN providing search results THEN the system SHALL implement interleaved context sliding windows
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL rank them by semantic relevance and contextual similarity
4. WHEN the codebase changes THEN the system SHALL incrementally update the semantic index

### Requirement 5: Darwin-Gödel Self-Improving Model

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an AI system that learns and improves from my coding patterns, so that it becomes more helpful over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes code interactions THEN it SHALL analyze patterns for self-improvement opportunities
2. WHEN improvement opportunities are identified THEN the Darwin-Gödel model SHALL generate code modifications
3. WHEN modifications are proposed THEN the system SHALL validate them through mini-benchmarking
4. IF improvements pass validation THEN the system SHALL integrate them into its codebase
5. WHEN self-modifications occur THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 6: Mini-Benchmarking System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI system to measure its own performance improvements, so that I can trust that changes actually make it better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system proposes improvements THEN it SHALL run mini-benchmarks to measure performance
2. WHEN benchmarks run THEN the system SHALL test code quality, response time, and accuracy metrics
3. WHEN benchmark results are available THEN the system SHALL compare against baseline performance
4. IF improvements don't meet thresholds THEN the system SHALL reject the proposed changes

### Requirement 7: Reinforcement Learning Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to learn from my feedback and coding preferences, so that it adapts to my specific development style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accepts or rejects AI suggestions THEN the system SHALL record this as training data
2. WHEN sufficient feedback is collected THEN the reinforcement learning system SHALL update model weights
3. WHEN the model is updated THEN the system SHALL improve future suggestions based on learned preferences
4. WHEN learning occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain user privacy and data security

### Requirement 8: Tool and MCP Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI IDE to integrate with external tools and Model Context Protocol servers, so that I can extend its capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external tools are available THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and integrate them
2. WHEN MCP servers are configured THEN the system SHALL establish connections and expose their capabilities
3. WHEN using external tools THEN the system SHALL provide unified interface and error handling
4. IF tool integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and fallback options

### Requirement 9: Context Management and Memory

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to maintain context across sessions and projects, so that it remembers my preferences and project-specific patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working on a project THEN the system SHALL maintain project-specific context and patterns
2. WHEN switching between files THEN the system SHALL preserve relevant context using sliding windows
3. WHEN sessions end THEN the system SHALL persist important context for future sessions
4. WHEN context grows large THEN the system SHALL intelligently compress and prioritize information

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI IDE to remain responsive even with large codebases, so that it doesn't slow down my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large codebases THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-second response times for common operations
2. WHEN memory usage increases THEN the system SHALL implement efficient garbage collection and caching
3. WHEN CPU usage is high THEN the system SHALL prioritize user-facing operations over background tasks
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust processing intensity
