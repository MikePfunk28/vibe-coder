# Implementation Plan

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: READ AI-ASSISTANT-FAILURE-LOG.md FIRST

**The AI assistant has COMPLETELY FAILED this project TWICE, wasting TWO MONTHS by ignoring specifications and building the wrong things. See AI-ASSISTANT-FAILURE-LOG.md for full details of this incompetence.**

## Phase 1: Complete VSCode Foundation with ALL Features



- [ ] 1. Get REAL VSCode OSS working with EVERY SINGLE FEATURE

  - [x] 1.1 Build working VSCode OSS with complete feature set that we then use as the base for our own AI IDE. Which incorporate the below.

  - [x] 1.1a How do we make a clone like cursor with codeoss at the base, is task.md correct? Because you should not be asking me between option A B or C. If A has CodeOSS 100% integrated as its base, it is a Cursor like, or vscode fork/clone then do that, but in no way do I want option B as that is building an EXTENSION. WHAT HAVE I SAID WE ARE BUILDING? DO YOU NOT get your own implementation? So Option C is great but I have a better one, option D, where you make sure codeOSS is 100% working and is integrated, and all the files needed are in the same git repository. Then go through the rest of the tasks. **Remember I have vscode as my editor I am using so testing it might need to be contained** Also, remember we are building a fully AI integrated vscode clone like Cursor. So it needs whatever vscode with github copilot have, or cursor with github copilot and other AI services.





    **⚠️ CRITICAL FAILURE REMINDER: The AI assistant wasted an ENTIRE MONTH of development time by completely ignoring this task specification. Despite the task clearly stating "Use REAL VSCode OSS" in "ai-ide/vscode-oss-complete directory", the AI assistant instead installed VSCodium (wrong foundation), created broken build scripts, and led the project down the wrong path for weeks. The AI assistant was told repeatedly that the specs said "CURSOR LIKE, VSCODE CLONE as BASE" but continued to ignore the requirements. Only after the user got extremely frustrated and angry did the AI assistant finally admit the truth about VSCodium lacking Microsoft marketplace access (no GitHub Copilot). This represents a complete failure of reading comprehension, following specifications, and basic competence. The AI assistant should have been building VSCode OSS from day 1 as explicitly specified in this task.**  ***Then DID THE SAME THING.  Even now we might finally have the AI IDE, using codeOSS as the base but you literally have gone through 4 weeks, and like 100 tasks, which I have said this many times.***

    - Use REAL VSCode OSS, must have all vscode/cursor/windsurf features, then we add on top
    - VSCode OSS fork in ai-ide/vscode-oss-complete directory (source exists but not built)
    - Use Visual Studio Build Tools (already available)
    - Use existing build scripts: ai-ide/FIX-REAL-VSCODE-BUILD.ps1, ai-ide/BUILD-COMPLETE-VSCODE.ps1
    - Fix Node.js version compatibility using existing ai-ide/fix-build-environment.ps1
    - Install all dependencies with yarn install in vscode-oss-complete directory
    - Build with yarn compile to get complete VSCode using existing ai-ide/build.ps1
    - Create executable and ensure it launches properly
    - Use existing launcher scripts: ai-ide/SIMPLE-VSCODE-LAUNCHER.ps1, ai-ide/START-COMPLETE-VSCODE.bat
    - Verify ALL VSCode features work using existing test framework in ai-ide/test-ai-ide.js

    - _Requirements: 1.1_

  - [x] 1.2 Integrate existing AI Assistant inside the IDE, that has two chats and can load two models at once, that you can choose to then automate into a worker/helper model.






  - [-] 1.2a Now I expect you to do every single task. You put them into the todo, and then you go through it one by one. Feature by feature. Now you had vscodium working, and I even saw you got codeoss or vscode working, which isnt that CodeOSS? How do you integrate github copilot, you said it needs CodeOSS, so I would say if you have questions, think, HOW DID CURSOR implement this?
