2. **Developer Resources**: Limited team vs Cursor's 20+ engineers
3. **Support**: Providing adequate user support and documentation
4. **Ecosystem**: Building extensions and community
5. **Funding**: Sustaining development without revenue

## 🎯 **Honest Conclusion**

**Current Reality**: Cursor is significantly ahead in almost every practical aspect. They have a polished, production-ready product with excellent UX, performance, and features.

**Our Opportunity**: There's a real market need for a privacy-first, open source AI IDE. Many developers want Cursor's functionality without the cloud dependency and subscription cost.

**Realistic Goal**: Become the leading open source AI IDE alternative to Cursor, not necessarily "better" but different in important ways (privacy, cost, customization).

**Timeline**: 12-18 months to become a viable alternative, 2-3 years to be truly competitive.

**Success Definition**: If we can capture 10-20% of developers who want AI IDE features but prefer open source/local solutions, that's a significant success.
