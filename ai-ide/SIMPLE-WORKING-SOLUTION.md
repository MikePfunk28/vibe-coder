# SIMPLE WORKING AI IDE SOLUTION

## The Reality Check
- VSCode OSS build is complex and has dependency hell
- You want something working NOW, not in 3 hours of debugging
- Cursor is literally just VSCode with AI extensions

## WORKING SOLUTION (5 minutes):

### Option 1: Use Your Existing VSCode + AI Extension
```bash
# 1. You already have VSCode installed
# 2. Create a simple AI extension
# 3. Install it
# 4. Done - you have AI IDE
```

### Option 2: Download VSCode OSS Binary (FASTEST)
```bash
# 1. Download pre-built VSCode OSS from GitHub releases
# 2. Add your AI extension
# 3. Rebrand it
# 4. Done
```

### Option 3: Use VSCodium (Pre-built VSCode OSS)
```bash
# 1. Download VSCodium (it's literally VSCode OSS pre-built)
# 2. Add AI extensions
# 3. Rebrand
# 4. Done
```

## What Cursor Actually Is:
- VSCode fork with AI extensions
