# Reinforcement Learning System for AI IDE

## Overview

The Reinforcement Learning (RL) system is a core component of the AI IDE that learns from user interactions and feedback to continuously improve the quality of AI assistance. The system adapts to individual user preferences and coding patterns, providing personalized AI recommendations.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Feedback Collection System** (`feedback_collection_system.py`)
   - `UserInteractionTracker`: Tracks all user interactions with the AI system
   - `FeedbackCollector`: Collects explicit and implicit feedback signals
   - `UserPreferenceExtractor`: Extracts user preferences from interaction patterns
   - `FeedbackAggregator`: Aggregates and analyzes feedback data

2. **Reinforcement Learning Engine** (`reinforcement_learning_engine.py`)
   - `StateEncoder`: Encodes interaction context into state vectors
   - `PolicyNetwork`: Neural network that learns optimal actions
   - `RewardFunction`: Calculates rewards based on user satisfaction
   - `ExperienceReplayBuffer`: Stores experiences for training
   - `ReinforcementLearningEngine`: Main orchestrator

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Feedback Collection

The system collects both explicit and implicit feedback:

**Explicit Feedback:**
- User ratings (1-5 scale)
- Direct comments and feedback
- Accept/reject actions on suggestions

**Implicit Feedback:**
- Time to accept suggestions
- Modifications made to suggestions
- Deletion of suggestions
- Context switching patterns
- Usage frequency patterns

### 2. State Representation

The system encodes interaction context into fixed-size state vectors including:

- **Interaction Type**: Code completion, generation, search, etc.
- **File Context**: File extension, line number, cursor position
- **Time Features**: Hour of day, day of week (cyclically encoded)
- **User History**: Recent interaction patterns and preferences
- **Context Features**: Selection presence, context length

### 3. Action Space

The RL system can recommend different types of actions:

- `provide_completion`: Code completion with different styles (concise/detailed)
- `provide_explanation`: Code explanations with varying depth
- `suggest_refactor`: Refactoring suggestions (local/global scope)
- `provide_examples`: Code examples (1 or multiple)
- `ask_clarification`: Request more information from user
- `no_action`: Take no action

### 4. Reward Function

Rewards are calculated based on:

- **Base Feedback**: Direct mapping from feedback type to reward
- **Signal Strength**: Weighted by confidence/strength of feedback
- **Time Decay**: More recent feedback weighted higher
- **Context Bonuses**: Additional rewards for productive hours, consistent file types
- **Consistency Bonuses**: Rewards for sustained positive feedback

### 5. Personalization

The system creates user-specific models through:

- **Experience Filtering**: Separate experience buffers per user
- **Model Fine-tuning**: User-specific neural network adaptations
- **Preference Learning**: Individual coding style and timing preferences
- **Adaptive Policies**: Different action preferences per user

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from feedback_collection_system import UserInteractionTracker, FeedbackCollector
from reinforcement_learning_engine import ReinforcementLearningEngine

# Initialize components
tracker = UserInteractionTracker()
collector = FeedbackCollector(tracker)
rl_engine = ReinforcementLearningEngine(collector)

# Track user interaction
interaction = UserInteraction(
    id="interaction_001",
    user_id="user_123",
    interaction_type=InteractionType.CODE_COMPLETION,
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    context={"cursor_position": 100, "file_type": "python"},
    ai_response={"suggestion": "def hello_world():"},
    user_action=None,
    session_id="session_001",
    file_path="main.py",
    line_number=10
)

tracker.track_interaction(interaction)

# Get AI action recommendation
action = rl_engine.get_action(interaction, user_history=[])
print(f"Recommended action: {action.action_type}")
print(f"Confidence: {action.confidence:.3f}")

# Collect user feedback
collector.collect_explicit_feedback(interaction.id, rating=4, comment="Good suggestion!")

# Learn from feedback
feedback_signals = collector.get_feedback_for_interaction(interaction.id)
rl_engine.learn_from_feedback(interaction, action, feedback_signals, user_history=[])
```

### User Adaptation

```python
# Adapt model to specific user after collecting enough data
rl_engine.adapt_to_user("user_123")

# Get user performance metrics
performance = rl_engine.get_user_performance("user_123")
print(f"Average reward: {performance['average_reward']:.3f}")
print(f"Positive feedback rate: {performance['positive_feedback_rate']:.3f}")
print(f"Has personalized model: {performance['has_personalized_model']}")
```

### Preference Analysis

```python
from feedback_collection_system import UserPreferenceExtractor

extractor = UserPreferenceExtractor(collector)
preferences = extractor.extract_preferences("user_123")

for pref in preferences:
    print(f"Preference: {pref.preference_type}")
    print(f"Value: {pref.preference_value}")
    print(f"Confidence: {pref.confidence:.3f}")
```

## Training Process

### 1. Experience Collection

- User interactions are continuously tracked
- Feedback signals are collected and processed
- Experiences are stored in replay buffer

### 2. Policy Learning

- Deep Q-Network (DQN) with experience replay
- Target network for stable training
- Epsilon-greedy exploration with decay
- Gradient clipping for stability

### 3. User Adaptation

- Fine-tuning on user-specific experiences
- Lower learning rate for personalization
- Policy gradient updates based on user rewards

### 4. Continuous Improvement

- Regular model checkpointing
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Automatic rollback for degraded performance
